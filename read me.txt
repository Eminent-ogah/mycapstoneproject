I'm Ogah Emmanuel

I'm a student of a tertiary institution and a future developer, in view.

I'm  a guy, my love and aspiration for  software developing is been in my mind since my childhood due to that, but  who aim to be developer, I choose to study software engineering but was'nt offered , but I really thank God that there's an aalternative to learn it.

I love being busy, and and I cherish peace a lot
